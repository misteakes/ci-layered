                Congrats, my son!!<br/>
                I can't believe my child has grown<br/>
                up and is now graduating (whoaaa).<br/>
                Your face makes you look 14 LOL.<br/>
                Anyways, I'm so proud of how far<br/>
                you've come and how far you will<br/>
                go in the future! It's crazy how we've<br/>
                actually become sistars throughout<br/>
                the time we've known one another.<br/>
                Parsons ain't ready for Misty Lin.<br/>
                They don't know what's coming!!<br/>
                I'm so happy you're staying in the<br/>
                city with me!!! Can't wait for our<br/>
                future college adventures together!<br/>
                <br/>
                Love, your Sistar (Passang)<br/>
